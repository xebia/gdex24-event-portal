Welcome to the DevOps Experience 2024@Tokyo!

The Global DevOps Experience is a series of global community events where communities around the world host events simultaneously.

So, with that said (wait, what did we say?), we’re thrilled to bring you the much-anticipated DevOps Experience!

However, since we’re cutting it really close, we’re going with the flow here (can we do it? Yes, we can!).

If you have a presentation topic, feel free to use this opportunity to take the stage. There are no restrictions on topics, so feel free to share whatever you want—things you want to say, experiences, successes, failures, you name it!

There’s no set end time, but we’ll wrap things up as the festivities wind down. (Is that okay? Sure it is!)
